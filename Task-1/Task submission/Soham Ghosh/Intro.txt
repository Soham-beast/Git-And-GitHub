My greetings to the respected senior members of IIC VSSUT,
I am Soham Ghosh, from Jharsuguda district of Odisha. I have completed my matriculation from Siksha Niketan, Brajrajnagar,
and my intermediate was from DAV Public School, IB Valley Area, Brajrajnagar. This is the first year of my Bachelors of 
Technology from Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology(formerly known as the University College of Engineering), Burla, 
in the department of Civil Engineering. I have been selected to the Idea Innovation Cell, in the domain of Computer Science 
and Electronics. Previously, I have learnt some of the basics of C++ programming, and currently I am learning the basics of
C programming.
The main reason for me entering to the IIC was that I had heard some very good remarks about the overall functioning, goals 
and ambitions of the club, and how it persistently tries harder and harder to achieve perfections. My present aim, as a 
member of the club is to learn some new and useful skills, and to work on my existing skills, to get better. The next I would 
want to do is to create something helpful for the masses, and serve the country. Because I believe that innovations aimed at 
the betterment and improvement of the way of life, our knowledge and our present understandings of the nature, that do not 
have any hazardous dispute with the nature itself, are an urgent necessity and are possible.
With this I conclude my Introduction. 
Hope to have an amazing and memorable time at IIC Burla.
Wishing you a nice day.
